# Hi, I'm Reece!

### I'm a software developer in Sydney, Australia.

<br/>

This GitHub is where I put some of the software I'm working on that's (mostly) suitable for public consumption.
This includes:

- Various projects/investigations that took my fancy at some point.
- A few polished items that do something useful.
- University coursework.

Hopefully any of my work may be useful or interesting to someone out in the wide world.
(Most of it has open source licensing, so just go ahead and take it!)  

### What drives my interest in software?

My two biggest loves in software are 1) software that's efficient, and 2) software that solves a real need.

For the first point, I love high-performance and low-latency software.
Optimising code is extremely interesting and fun for me!
I aspire to eventually be like one of those guys who reason about caches, branch prediction, and CPU architecture.

For point 2, one of my biggest tech-related pet peeves is useless and/or janky software.
Code that doesn't work properly, is hard to use, hard to read, hard to reason about... I cannot stand it.
Hopefully the work I present here doesn't fulfil any of those qualities.

### What technologies do I work with?

I started programming in C++, and I keep coming back to it, due to its more-or-less unrivalled performance capabilities.  
But, sadly you can't do everything easily or nicely in C++, so I use a good deal of Python too.  

In terms of specific coding practices, I'm into functional programming, generic programming, and data-oriented design.  
I'm often on the fence between super nice, clean, robust functional coding, and ultra-performance-driven data oriented.
This is an ongoing internal struggle for me.

### Where are these "polished" useful project?
